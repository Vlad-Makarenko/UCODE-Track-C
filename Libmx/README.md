## String pack
Function name|Description|
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|```mx_strlen```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strlen``` .|
|```mx_swap_char```|Function which will swap the characters of the string using pointers. Do nothing if ```s1``` or ```s2``` does not exist.|
|```mx_str_reverse```|Function which reverses string using pointers. Do nothing if string does not exist.|
|```mx_strdel```|Function that takes a pointer to string, then frees the string memory with ```free``` and sets string to ```NULL``` .|
|```mx_del_strarr```|Function that takes pointer to a NULL-terminated array of strings, deletes content of array, frees array memory with ```free``` and sets pointer to ```NULL``` .|
|```mx_get_char_index```|Function that finds index of the first occurrence of character ```c``` in a string str. String is a sequence of characters excluding the trailing ``` \0 ``` character.|
|```mx_strdup```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strdup``` .|
|```mx_strndup```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strdup``` .|
|```mx_strcpy```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strcpy``` .|
|```mx_strncpy```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strncpy``` .|
|```mx_strcmp```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strcmp``` .|

|```mx_strstr```|Function which has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```strstr``` .|
|```mx_get_substr_index```|Function that finds a index of substring.|
|```mx_count_substr```|Function that counts number of occurrences of substring in a string.|
|```mx_count_words```|Function which count words in the string. Word is a sequence of characters separated by delimiter.|
|```mx_strnew```|Function that: • allocates memory for a string of a specific ```size``` and one additional byte for terminating ``` '\0' ```  • initializes each character with ``` '\0' ``` • string of a specific size and terminated by ``` '\0' ```  • ```NULL``` if the creation fails..|
|```mx_strtrim ```|Function which creates new string without whitespace characters at the beginning and the end of the string and frees all unused memory with ```free ```.|
|```mx_del_extra_spaces ```|Function that creates new string without whitespace characters in the beginning and at the end of a string. It puts in the new string exactly one space character between words and frees all unused memory. Word is a sequence of characters separated by whitespaces.|
|```mx_strsplit ```|Function that converts a string ```s``` to the NULL-terminated array of words and frees all unused memory.|
|```mx_strjoin ```|Create a function concatenates strings s1 and s2 into new string and terminates new string with ``` '\0' ``` .|
|```mx_file_to_str ```|Function takes a filename as a parameter and then reads the data from file into the string.|
|```mx_replace_substr ```|Function that replaces all occurrences of ``` sub``` in ```str``` with ```eplace``` .|72|
|```mx_read_line ```||90|


## Memory pack
Function name|Description|
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|```mx_memset```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```memset``` .|
|```mx_memcpy```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```memcpy``` .|
|```mx_memccpy```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard stdlib function ```memccpy``` .|
|```mx_memcmp```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard stdlib function ```memcmp``` .|
|```mx_memchr```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard stdlib function ```memchr``` .|
|```mx_memrchr```|The ```mx_memrchr``` function is like the ```mx_memchr``` function, except that it searches backwardfrom the end of the ```n``` bytes pointed to by ```s``` instead of forward from the beginning.|
|```mx_memmem```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function memmem .|
|```mx_memmove```|Function that has the same behaviour as standard libc function ```memmove``` .|

|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|```mx_create_node```|Function which creates a new node of linked list. Function must assign parameter ```data ```to the list variable ```data``` .|
|```mx_push_front```|Function that inserts a new node of ```t_list``` type with the given parameter ```data``` at the beginning of the linked list.|
|```mx_push_back```|Function that inserts a new node of ```t_list``` type with the given parameter ```data``` at the end of the linked list.|
|```mx_pop_front```|Function that removes the first node of the linked list and frees allocated for the node memory.|
